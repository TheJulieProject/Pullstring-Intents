# Pullstring-Intents
A collection of intents for use with Pullstring Author, to make it easier to collect information from people in the authoring 

Pullstring Author by [Pullstrng](http://pullstring.com) is a powerful conversational interface editor for creating chatbots. It uses the concept of intents to help parse what a user is trying to convey. The package comes with a number of intents built-in, but it turns out that there are a number of other things you might want to capture from your users. 

As part of another project, I am writing a fair few conversational bot elements, and figured that it would be useful to share these with the world. 

If you use any of these intents, that's fantastic. You're welcome. We do ask that if you make additional intents, or if you improve the ones in this GitHub, please consider re-contributing them to this project. It will save us all some valuable time! :) 

All the best,
